<h1 align="center"> 💻 <strong>Ft_printf</strong> </h1>

## 🏷️ **About the project**
> Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() aren’t enough

This project is about recoding a simplified version of the printf function.

## ⚙️ **Requirements**
The function must be written in C. It must compile with clang and the following flags :
- [x] -Wall
- [x] -Wextra
- [x] -Werror

## ➡️ **Difference with the original printf**
> Don't implement the buffer management of the original printf

We have to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX% for our mandatory part.

## 📍 **Bonus**
I started to do the bonus when I my madatory part worked perfectly which is a BIG mistake. As statedin the subject :
> If you plan to complete the bonus part, think about the implementation of your extra features from the start. This way, you will avoid the pitfalls of a naive approach.

Doing the bonus meant re-doing all my functions so I gave up.
You can still see part of my code for the bonus, it can give you hints on how to do it. Just check `ft_check_flags_bonus.c`.
